# unit-4-game

### Star Wars Game


### How to get started

To get started having fun with the game, users must go to https://tothinator.github.io/unit-4-game/ and choose the character they want to play.

### Design Choices

I didn't spend a lot of time on style for this game, however I tried to make it so that whoever you chose, to win, you must fight the enemies with the lowest health first.

### Code Design

I spent more time fleshing out resuable functions for this project, however there is still quite a bit of code that I need to break down even more so that it is more clean.  Most notably is the updateText() function, which is what I named it at first, but it ended up being my main function to determine whether or not the user won or lost.

### Possible future improvements

1.  The main improvement would be making the game/webpage more "flashy."  Sitting down and spending time on this would drastically improve the appeal of the game.
2.  Sound effects of lightsabers would be pretty cool
